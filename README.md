Note: This web app is build using the Firebase Studio. For generating stories I used the Gemini API Key. You can fork this repo and use or modify as you want, but gives a star first, if you like it, I added a preview link of this tool. But you will only get the 15 generation per day, because, this is run on Free Gemini Model.
